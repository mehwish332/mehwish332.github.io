  <h3> There was a time where the world wasn't revovled around technology, and although its hard to imagine, it is in fact true. Its normal for the older generations to complain about our use of technoglogy but the truth is, our world is evolving because of it and here's a few reasons why...</h3>

  <h2>The Health Industry </h2>
</header>
  <h3> Technology has constant changes as it advances over time. For example, technology has a big part in the health industy for one, and because of that, by 2025, Alzheimers and Dementia will practically be little to none because of the advanced, and improved technology made on the daily. Due to technology it is easier to make new cures for common diseases, and ultimately saves lives. For example, during an emergency an ambulace is required as time is of the essence, and ambulaces is a type of transportation, and all transportation has a technological aspect or function to it. And of course, the cures and medicne made is more improved because of technology, and its research. </h3>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  </header>
  <h3> Technology is also a way to contact people around the world, and that has many helpful aspects to it. For example, if one were to move away from family, technology is one of the many things keeping the family together, it ables them to talk to one another, which is helpful, especially during emergencies. Another helpful scenario is the news. Have you ever heard the quote "we're all in this togther"? Well in some cases it really is true. For example, if something is going on with the earth, and or people, we are notified around the world, and thats helpful because many people can get the help they may not have access to, espeically in non developed regions. Word travles through technology, so the news, articles, and even social media covers any severe situation around the world. Everyone is made aware of the tragedies, natural disasters, and plotical problems and or changes which may affect many of us in our own ways. Not only is technology used to 'spread the word' but it comes in use when it comes to interations and transfering.  </h3>

  <h3> Technology is also used for other things such as transportation. As mentioned before, transporation obvioulsy has the technological function and overall is one of the most helpful things in the past generations. There was always different ways to get place to place without using technology however, none were very easy. For example, back in the day the most common transportation used was ships, which weren't built with any technological function. Instead, one would have access to padels and their boat and thats about it, nothing more, nothing less. Another common transporation used even now, is walking. As tiring as it is, thats all people used to do because they had no access to technology (no transportation) and so, it was hard to complain. Now we have our advanced technology, so commom transportation used on the daily is trains, cars, busses, ships, airplanes, and yes, the original yet iconic source (or choice) of transportation, walking! </h3>

  <h2>Artifical Intellegence (opinionated)<h2>

  <h3>  Personally, I dont know a lot about AI's. Partially because I have no intrest in learning about them or more frankly, using them. AI's can be technological functions in our phones (aka siri), or it can be its own device (alexa, google home, etc.), but most of the time, both come to no use. From what I belive, they just make things go a little faster. For example the AI in our phones (siri) does things like finding out the weather, opening apps, and googling the questions we stupendously ask. So basically, they do all of the things we can, but just a little faster, but time isn't so much of the essence so it isn't exactly required. Google home or Alexa however does a moe helpful job, turn off the lights. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes AI's are helpful in a working environment but it depends if the technology is doing your job. AI's with the robotic functions should be something many of us should fear, since according to Mskinsey Global Institute report, approximately 375 million jobs will be lost by the end of 2030 due to this specific advanced technology. In summary, the biggest thing AI's are doing is making employment rates plummet lower than its ever been in the last few decades. Of course, they may come to great use to other people, but from exprience (and in my opinion), it doesnt matter too much, to me at least.

  <h3> Technology does have its own pros and cons but if used correctly with good intentions, its overall a great help to people, and improves our lifestyle, most of the time:). We continue to advance the functions of most technology, with the intent of making our lives much easier and quite frankly, better. It is important to remember that there are pros and cons to every technological, and robotic functions, and it shouldn't be used every second of the day because as mentioned before, technology is only in our access for more help, and for the intent to get things done much faster and easier. </h3>
